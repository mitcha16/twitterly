            Mitch has an astounding ability to pick up new technology in an expedient fashion and when he does - he owns his development.
            His knowledge is thorough and he quickly becomes a SME. His personality and drive make him a leader, approachable, and a
            pleasure to work with.</h4>

            As a student in our program, Mitch was always a pleasure to work with. He was an excellent team member, always supporting others,
            and not afraid of tackling complex problems. He has an innate curiosity, a calm demeanor, and good ability
            to receive feedback. I would love to have him as a student again.</h4>
